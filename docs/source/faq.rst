FAQ
======


Is Fields2Cover only focused on agriculture/UGV?
-------------------------------------------------

This library is an outcome of a research project about offline Coverage Path Planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Agriculture.

Despite any other algorithm outside this specific category is also outside of the scope of the project, it is not completely outside of the scope of this library. Mantainers will not develop any algorithm that cannot be used on UGV for agriculture, but PR will be accepted.


How frequently is the library updated?
--------------------------------------

Although mayor versions of the library will be released once a year, minor changes, bug fixing or PR will be added constantly. Do not expect new algorithms developed by maintainers out of a mayor release.

Of course, if you have an idea and you want other people to benefits from it, we will accept PR as soon as possible.
