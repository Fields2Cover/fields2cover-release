Is Fields2Cover only focused on agriculture/UGV?
------------------------------------------------

This library is an outcome of a research project about offline Coverage Path Planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Agriculture.

Despite any other algorithm outside this specific category is also outside of the scope of the project, it is not completely outside of the scope of this library. Maintainers won't develop any algorithm that cannot be used on UGV for agriculture, but PR are welcomed.


How frequently is the library updated?
--------------------------------------

Although major versions of the library are released yearly, minor changes, bug fixing or PR are added constantly. Do not expect new algorithms developed by maintainers out of major releases.

Of course, if you have cool ideas and you want other people to benefit from them, open an issue or PR.
